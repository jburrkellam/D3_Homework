          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Overall Health Levels</h2>
          
          <p>This scatter plot takes a look a every states median income versus the percentage
            of its population that lacks access to health insurance.  The plot will
            be able to tell you this by hovering over the corresponding circle, where we can deduce
            that states with higher median incomes tend to have a lower percentage of its population 
            without access to health insurance. </p>

          <p>In observing the dataset, it is interesing to see what regions of the country have the highest 
            median incomes and in turn, the lowest percentages of populations without access to health insurance.  The northeastern
           states in particular mostly has higher median incomes and more citizens with access the health insurance.
           The southeastern states are all clustered with lower median incomes and lower percentages of their population with
           access to health insurance.  There are many economic factors at play here as the northeast has always had high paying jobs 
           and a strong commercial workforce, while the southeast is rooted in manufacturing and farming. </p>

          <p>From the data presented, as a person looking to make a solid income while also guaranteeing access to health insurance, it would 
            be imperative to look to the northeastern United States first to make a living.</p>
